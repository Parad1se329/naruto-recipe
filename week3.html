    <p>Fresh strawberries: The strawberries should be hulled and sliced.
        Lemon juice: Lemon juice brightens the sweetness of fruit and also helps preserve the colors. Other citrus juices like lime or orange can be subbed in.
        Honey: You can also use agave syrup or sugar. Besides adding flavor, sweeteners help the texture by preventing ice crystals from forming.
        Salt: Salt accentuates the flavors and balances the sweetness</p>
